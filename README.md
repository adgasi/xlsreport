# xlsreport
Modifies a given *.xls file by creating a table for signature in specific cells with some text and styles.

## Motivation
At the beginning of the month I have to generate the work record sheet for the previous month. Work record system allows to download it as a *.xls file. Having it downloaded, the following steps need to be performed:
1. Manually edit a file and add a specific table for signature
2. Print and sign the document myself
3. Hand over to supervisor

With that script I can get rid of step number 1.
It's not a huge thing, but it was a good motivation to write the first Python script which can automate some boring stuff.
